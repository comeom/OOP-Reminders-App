Project Objective:
We want to design and implement a system in Java that allows a user to manage tasks through a GUI based reminders application.


Project Description:
The app will provide various means of organizing tasks. At the furthest level out, there will be reminder lists. The user can create, edit and delete reminder lists. Upon selecting a reminder list to view, the user will then be able to see the existing reminders within the list, create new reminders, edit reminders, and mark off reminders. Upon selecting a reminder within a list, the details of the reminder will be displayed and able to be edited. The fields of each reminder will be a title, notes, date, time, and location, which each can be edited upon viewing. The list that the current reminder is in can also be edited, in this mode. The way that a user clears will be through selecting the reminder/reminders that the user wishes to clear and then clicking a button to remove said reminders. 


System Design:
We will first create a use case diagram for our system. The system will be designed with OOP principles and will consist of several classes and methods to manage the functionality. The two most key classes will be the MainGUI class which will manage the various windows and the Reminder class which will contain all of the necessary attributes for each reminder as described above. A ReminderList class will also be necessary to manage the lists of reminders that the user has created. A FileManager class will also be necessary in order to save and load the data that the user has created. 

Deliverables:
By the end of this project, we hope to create a fully functional Reminders app, with user-friendly and intuitive user experience, a nice-looking GUI, error checking, and comprehensive documentation.
